## Welcome to my Personal Website!
I familiarized myself about React.js by building my personal website. I mainly used [React Materialize](https://react-materialize.github.io/#/) with [React Animate on Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animate-on-scroll) and [React Icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/) for the front-end framework.
